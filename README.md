# Hi There

You’ve found my Neovim config. How exciting!

If you’re browsing for something to steal, try looking in `./lua/` or `./init.lua` for bits that can be nabbed, usually without side effects. Each section or file should have a comment explaining what it does. The ones I’m using are `require`’d in `./init.lua`. I also try to make tidy commits with descriptive messages, so scroll through there if you want to know what I’ve been playing with lately.

If you don’t understand something you see, reach out! I love helping people get more out of my favourite editor. My email is my first name @ my GitHub handle .com.
