# Hi There

You’ve found my Neovim config. How exciting!

If you’re browsing for something to steal, try looking in `./lua/` or `./init.lua` for bits that can be nabbed, usually without side effects. Each section or file should have a comment explaining what it does. The home-grown modules I’m using are `require`’d in `./init.lua`. I also try to make tidy commits with descriptive messages, so scroll through the commit log if you want to know what I’ve been playing with lately. My plugin list is in `./plugin/paq.lua`, and plugin configs live in `./plugin/`, where each plugin gets a separate file.

If you don’t understand something you see, reach out! I love helping people get more out of my favourite editor. My email is my first name @ my GitHub handle .com.
